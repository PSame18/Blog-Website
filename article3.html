                    <h2>Creativity</h2>

                    <p>
                        Creativity empowers you to find unique solutions to problems, and see things in ways that you least expect.
                        It goes beyond the artistic impressions and aesthetics, and is a crucial building block of change.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        Without Learning, you will not be able to advance and progress in life.
                        Yet, there are many of us who always fall behind not because they don't have the intellectual ability,
                        but because they don't know how to learn effectively.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Memory</h2>
                    <p>
                        And then we have Memory, one of the most vital components, because without that you have nothing to fall back on,
                        nothing to gain from all the learning or experiences that you're exposed to on this earth.
                        And with an ever increasing amount of information available, how can you store up as much knowledge as you can without overloading?
                    </p>

                    <h2>Focus</h2>
                    <p>
                        And with any and everything that you do, a certain amount of Focus is always given.
                        Whether it's the career ladder that you've been climbing, or the responsibility of being a parent,
                        Focus is a flow that allows you to push towards the progress that you're striving for.
                        Without focus, we find ourselves lost, demotivated and stuck in a rut.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many of us aren't happy in life or with our jobs and responsibilities because we lack Motivation,
                        and an overarching purpose as l already mentioned earlier.
                        Motivation helps drive you forward, and gives you the focus achieve your purpose.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Habits</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you realize, every new day that comes is filled with routines.
                        Whether it's getting ready for work in the morning, putting your kids to bed in the evening,
                        or setting aside time during the weekends for family time and activities,
                        it all happens as a result of habits that you've built over time.
                        Therefore Habits dictate a big part of your life.
                        Pursuing happiness, money or meaning all have a dependency on your habits.
                        If you find yourself being controlled by bad or negative habits,
                        it's more likely to hinder you from productive and reaching those goals.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Time</h2>
                    <p>
                        This also ends up leading to bad use of Time, or poor time management.
                        You might fel like you haven't buit a stable career yet because you lack proper time management.
                        You find yourself spending a lot of time being busy, yet producing little outcomes Or certain habits
                        might be consuming time that you can be using for other more productive tasks.
                        Perhaps you're on your way to retirement, and feel like it's too late to find new meaning to your life.
                        There's not much time left to embark on a new journey again.
                    </p>
